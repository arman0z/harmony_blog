# **26 Reasons to Book with Deedee – Part 2**

Now, we’re on a roll. Let’s pick up with the letter M. 

**M-Multigenerational**  
I can’t think of a better place to use as a home base for an extended family—including everyone from grandparents to newborns—than one of Deedee’s Apartments. You have so many options\! You can all stay together in one large apartment that sleeps up to 12 people or book multiple apartments in the same building. With spacious living rooms, fully equipped kitchens, formal dining rooms and multiple bathrooms, you’ll have plenty of room to visit, cook, eat, watch movies and play games together. Our duplex lofts on Newark Avenue in Jersey City even have semi-private master suites\!

**N-Nightlife**  
Jersey City’s lively nightlife includes sleek hotel clubs on the waterfront, theater and live music, steps from your door. Hoboken beats out Greenwich Village as a hub for drinking establishments. With 120 gastropubs, taverns, rooftop bars, sports bars, nightclubs, local dives, even a Key West-style bar serving tropical drinks—it officially has the “most bars per capita in America.” Something for everyone steps from your apartment\!

**O-Outdoor spaces**  
Many Deedee’s apartments have private backyards, where you can barbecue and dine alfresco on a warm evening. Relax on a private furnished roof terrace with stunning city views. As I said earlier, the sky-rise apartments have an outdoor pool and hot tub—a great way to relax at the end of a day navigating the streets NYC. 

**P-Personal service**  
From the beginning, the heart of our business has been our fanatical devotion to pampering every guest with personal service. So many times, after you book, you’re left on your own—to find your way from the airport, retrieve the key from a lock box and figure out where to buy breakfast staples when you’re fighting jetlag. You might find a binder full of information, but a binder can never provide a sense of comfort and safety when you arrive in a brand new place that a person waiting for you with a smile and a warm welcome can, especially when you’re feeling tired and disoriented after a long day of travel\!

So, I built a team of personal service Superstars who make it their mission to ensure your booking experience and stay with us are exceptional. Our Reservations Manager is responsive and infinitely patient in answering all your questions. When you arrive at your apartment, a member of our guest services team will be there to let you in and make sure you have everything you need, from extra towels to directions to the nearest PATH Station. After that, we are just a text or phone call away throughout your stay.

**Q-Quiet streets**  
The crowds and noise of Manhattan can take their toll at the end of a day sightseeing. What a pleasure to return to a tree-lined street in Jersey City, where the residential streets are perfect for strolling and you’ll feel like part of the neighborhood. Join local residents relaxing in nearby Hamilton Park or Van Vorst Park for a weekly farmer’s markets, outdoor movies and kid’s play areas.

**R-Renovated to a high standard**  
Each of Deedee’s homes-away-from-home has been completely remodeled and furnished to the highest standard. Expect gleaming hardwood or polished concrete floors warmed by hydronic radiant heat and fully equipped modern kitchens with stainless-steel appliances. If an industrial loft or modern high-rise is not your style, we know you’ll appreciate the beautifully preserved architectural detail in our historic brownstone apartments, including original marble fireplace mantels, etched glass and ornate plaster moldings.

**S-Style**  
Unlike the average, blah hotel room, any one of Deedee’s Apartments could be featured in a design magazine\! And you won’t pay Manhattan prices for the upscale experience. Rather than mass-produced furniture and dingy bedspreads, each apartment is unique, with a stylish décor featuring Mid-century furnishings, chic industrial lighting, handwoven rugs and gallery-style artwork from West Elm.    

**T-Testimonials**

We receive hundreds of reviews and I read and cherish every one. Many who say they “never write reviews” have written volumes about the many things they loved about their stay with us. I’m especially proud that we’ve managed to impress even those guests who admit they are “picky” or call themselves “travel snobs”\!

**U-Ultra-clean**  
Rather than hotel-smell, you’ll be greeted with a fresh scent, plus crisp, clean linens and fluffy towels and a spotlessly clean retreat every time.   
   
**V-Value**  
Bottom line: A spacious apartment in Jersey City or Hoboken will cost less than what you’d pay for a tiny hotel room in Manhattan. We’ll help transform your NYC visit from good to fantastic—for a fraction of what you’d expect to spend\!

**W-Washer/dryer**  
By the way, many of Deedee’s Apartments also have a washer and dryer, a godsend if you’re traveling with kids. And it’s just so much nicer to return from vacation with clean clothes.

**X-X Factor**  
Deedee’s Apartments’ diverse collection of lofts, high-rise apartments, and duplexes in lovingly restored brownstones and our off-the-charts personal service have made us Hoboken and Jersey City’s highest-rated host.

**Y-Your anniversary (birthday)**  
Many of our guests are celebrating a milestone anniversary or birthday during their stay. If you need balloons, flowers or a cake for a quiet family celebration, we’re ready to help. We can have a bottle of champagne for your wife’s 40th birthday chilling in the fridge when you arrive. What a nice surprise\!

**Z-Zzz\!**   
Get ready to the best night’s sleep you’ve had in a long while\! Every bed (and many sofa beds) have super-comfortable Leesa memory foam mattresses, layered with crisp, white linens, a down comforter and coverlet. After your first night, you’ll dream of sinking into your bed at the end of every day of your stay.
