# **10 Things We Love About Hoboken** 

Here at Deedee’s Apartments, we’re celebrating our newest property in charming Hoboken, just across the Hudson River from NYC. Tucked into a cobblestone lane around the corner from the boutiques, bistros and rooftop bars lining Washington Street, this Huge, Stylish 3BR Loft \[link to: 318C 3 property listing on Deedee’s website\], is an ultra-modern retreat with 1,450 sq. ft. (134 sqm) of space—perfect for families, friends and business travelers. 

A little history: this lane was where the original residents once had their horse stables, or mews. Its paving stones were ships’ ballast in the 1800s\! Of course, everything inside is up-the-minute, from the upscale, open-plan kitchen and spa-style bathrooms to the stylish Mid-century modern décor that is Deedee’s signature style.

We’re excited about expanding our offerings in Hoboken, a city I fell in love with on my very first visit. Like Jersey City, Hoboken is just minutes from Manhattan by PATH train or ferry. It also shares the jaw-dropping Hudson riverfront views of the NYC skyline. But Hoboken has fewer high-rises, acres of green space and more quaint lanes and quiet, family-friendly neighborhoods lined with beautiful brownstones. It also has a fun college-town vibe, thanks to students attending Stevens Institute of Technology.

## **Here are 10 things I adore about Hoboken**  

**Its size**  
At just one-square-mile (2.5 square kilometers), Hoboken was ranked the \#1 Most Walkable of 2,978 U.S. cities by Walkscore.com. Everything is steps away\!  

**It parks and piers**   
A stroll along Hoboken’s waterfront pedestrian walkway will bring you to parks at Piers A, C, and 13, where you can picnic, attend outdoor movies, concerts and festivals, and go kayaking and fishing. 

Your first stop after exiting the Hoboken Terminal is **Pier A Park** (Sinatra Drive and 1st Street), named one of the nation’s top 10 urban parks by the Urban Land Institute. I love joining the free sunset yoga classes here on warm summer evenings, relaxing on the broad lawn or strolling out to the gazebo at the end of the pier. Pier A also hosts free movies under the stars on Wednesday nights from June through August. Bring a blanket and some popcorn and enjoy\! 

Family-friendly **Pier C Park** (Sinatra Drive near 4th Street) is actually an island in the Hudson River, attached to the waterfront walkway by pier. Kids love the half-acre playground, which includes a large slide and sandbox, water play area and lots of green space.

Further along, **Pier 13 Park** (1301 Sinatra Drive) is a warm-weather dining and entertainment hub for families and groups of friends. It has a kids’ playgrounds, water sports like paddle boarding and kayaking, yummy food trucks and a biergarten.  

**Its water sports**  
The Hudson River isn’t just for ferries and sailboats. It’s also a great place to go paddle boarding and kayaking during the warmer months. The Pier 13 Boating Club offers classes in both for adults and children and provides fun tours along the Hudson River. Head to the Hoboken Cove Community Boathouse for "Free Paddling" days in the protected Hoboken Cove. Unfortunately, their popular one- to two-hour "Public River Trips" can’t be booked in advance, but you can try your luck in a lottery for an experience many residents covet. No prior paddling experience required\! 

**Its festivals**   
Throughout the year, Hoboken plays host to dozens of festivals celebrating the arts and food\! The Italian Festival, Irish Festival, Chili Cook-Off, BBQ Festival and Restaurant Week are just a few. My personal favorite is Mutzfest, which pays homage to mozzarella cheese in January. A handful to Hoboken’s best delis and restaurants proudly showcase their mozzarella creations for you to sample as they go head-to-head for the title “Hoboken’s Best Mutz”. Past festivals have included Cannoli Eating Contests and Frank Sinatra Sing-A-Longs. Only in Hoboken\!

**Its bar-hopping**  
Hoboken beats out Greenwich Village as a hub for drinking establishments. With 120 gastropubs, taverns, rooftop bars, sports bars, nightclubs, local dives, even a Key West-style bar serving tropical drinks—it officially has the “most bars per capita in America.” You’ll find something for everyone within the city’s single square mile.   
	  
I love heading over to the **Pilsener Haus & Biergarten**, 1422 Grand St., where you can choose from 20 premium ales and IPAs on draft and 50 European and American craft beers in bottles. They pair perfectly with a menu of brats, sausages, schnitzel and giant Bavarian soft pretzels. The family-style dining tables are perfect for big groups and on cold winter nights you can even rent an igloo.  **Tip:** On Tuesdays everything is 50% off, if you pay cash. 

**Its food**  
Hoboken may be tiny, but its culinary scene is mighty enough to lure foodies from NYC across the Hudson River. If you decide to stay here, lucky you\! You’ll be steps from a melting pot of ethnic cuisines: Japanese, Mexican, Persian, Moroccan-French, Cuban— and, of course, the best Italian food you’ll ever eat. Where else could you go cannoli- tasting at a handful of the most authentic Italian bakeries this side of Sicily?   

**Its farmers markets**  
Hoboken has two great farmer’s markets where—from summer into late fall—you can buy organic produce, homemade breads and pastries, pickles, olives, fish, meat, fresh flowers, herbs, pressed juices and baked-from-scratch pies. Of course, fresh mutz is a must\! **The Hoboken Farmers’ Market** (Garden Street between 4th and 5th Streets) is open Tuesdays from 2 to 7:30 p.m. If Tuesday doesn’t work, you may want to spend a sunny Saturday morning stocking up at **The Garden Street Farmers Market** in the Garden Street Mews at 14th and Garden Streets. It’s open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.    

**Its ‘Cake Boss’**  
Carlo’s Bakery (95 Washington Street) was Hoboken institution, renowned for its extravagant wedding cakes, long before its master baker’s cake design was voted “the best cake in America”. Now, owner Buddy Valastro and his staff, including his mom, four sisters and three brothers-in-law, take viewers behind the scenes on the Food Network’s “Cake Boss” TV show. Every week offers a tantalizing peek at how the family produces spectacular wedding cakes and specialty cakes such as Britney Spears' circus-theme 27th birthday cake. 

You don’t have to be headed down the aisle to enjoy a cannoli, cupcake and other decadent confection. And if you’re sufficiently impressed you may be inspired to squeeze a two-hour cake decorating class into your itinerary or purchase baking supplies for your kitchen. 

**Its shopping**  
You could easily spend an entire afternoon browsing in the boutiques, gift shops and home décor stores in downtown Hoboken. Check out Washington General Store (509 Washington Street) for one-of-a-kind gifts and unique products to spruce up your home and Peper & Parlor (938 Washington Street) for chic designer apparel. But be sure to venture off the main thoroughfare into cobbled side streets, where you’ll find vintage threads at Mint Market (303 1st Street) and a new read at the cozy Little City Books (100 Bloomfield Street). 

**Its arts scene**  
The Monroe Center for the Arts Center (720 Monroe Street) is the heart of Hoboken’s creative scene. The two buildings, once part of the much larger Levelor blinds factory complex, have 180,000 square feet (16722 square meters) of artist studios and retail space. Wander among art galleries, exhibitions and shops and watch painters, photographers, performing artists, fashion and jewelry designers in-residence at work.

I hope this gives you 10 good reasons to stay in Hoboken next time you visit NYC. If you do, I’d love it if you’d come back here and share your experiences\!
