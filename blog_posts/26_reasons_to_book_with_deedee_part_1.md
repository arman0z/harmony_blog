# **26 Reasons to Book with Deedee – Part 1**

Having a little fun here. I came up with 26 reasons to book one of Deedee’s Apartments in Jersey City or Hoboken—one for each letter of the alphabet.

1. **Affordable**

If you’re a family of six visiting New York City with teens or grandparents in tow, you’ll need at least two hotel rooms in a city where even two-star accommodations can cost $400 a night\! Add hotel taxes and fees and you could be spending up to $1,000 a day before breakfast\! Not to mention gratuities for the valet, the bellman, and the guy who brings you room service. Staying with Deedee in an apartment that can comfortably accommodate all of you will cost you a fraction of that\!

2. **Big\!**

The average Manhattan hotel room is about 400 square feet (37 square meters). Sure, you’ll be out sightseeing all day. But, do you really want to return to a cramped room, where you’re tripping over your luggage and each other?

Deedee’s Apartments range in size from a 950-square-foot (88 square meters) studio to a 1,950-square-foot (181 square meters) four-bedroom duplex. All have living rooms (some two\!), a full kitchen and plenty of room (and privacy) for everyone. Some even have a private backyard or furnished roof deck with a barbecue grill\!

3. **Character and Convenience** 

Our curated collection of boutique properties includes a range of styles and experiences—hip industrial lofts, lovingly restored Victorian brownstones, sleek high-rise apartments with million-dollar views, sophisticated duplexes with furnished roof decks and cozy flats with private backyards.

All of Deedee’s Apartments in Hoboken and Jersey are within walking distance of a PATH station or ferries that will have you on the streets of Manhattan within 15 minutes. (Some Manhattanites complain that it takes them 30 minutes to travel to Midtown from the Upper West Side\!)  

4. **Details that Matter**

Super-comfortable mattresses, high thread-count sheets, over-sized super-fluffy towels, a great cup of coffee in the morning. These are things you can’t always take for granted when you’re booking accommodations, but that matter so much when you’re away from home. 

5. **Extras**

Some NYC hotels charge a “destination fee”—sometimes called a facility fee or urban fee—to cover amenities such as Wi-fi, phone calls or access to the fitness center. You could book a “good deal” only to find hundreds of dollars in add-on fees at check-out\! At Deedee’s, we go out of our way to spoil you with extras: free Wi-fi, 65-inch TVs with free premium channels, shampoo and body wash dispensers in the shower, a Keurig coffeemaker with free coffee pods/creamer and filtered water in the fridge.  

6. **Family-friendly**

Bouncing off the walls (and each other) in a too-small hotel room at the end of a day of sightseeing is no vacation. Coming home to a two- or three-bedroom flat or duplex apartment where everybody has lots of space and privacy makes all the difference. The kids can unwind by streaming a movie on the TV in their own bedrooms, while you have a cat nap or a cocktail. Best all, you can tuck little ones in at their regular bedtime and stay up as late as you like. If you need a crib, Pack ‘n Play, highchair or child gate, say the word. We’ll make sure everything you need is waiting in the apartment when you arrive. Older kids can safely roam the vibrant downtown in Jersey City or Hoboken, browsing in hip boutiques or hanging out at fun festivals.  
 

7. **Great for girlfriend getaways**

Anytime is a great time to gather your gal pals together for a weekend of retail adventures, rooftop cocktails, meals you don’t have to cook and late-night gab sessions.  Super-stylish Deedee’s Apartments—minutes by train from Manhattan—are so much more spacious and comfortable (and need I say, affordable?) than a Manhattan hotel room. Picture climbing up to a private, furnished roof deck with a pitcher of margaritas. Order in without the room service surcharge. Or head out to dance at a club right across the street. (Best of all, you won’t have to crowd into the same tiny bathroom when you’re getting ready.)

8. **High-rise amenities**

Staying in our sky-rise apartments, you’ll have access to club amenities, including a swimming pool, hot tub, state-of-the-art fitness center, game room and barbecue grilling stations.

9. **Insider knowledge**

You’ll never be on your own with a guidebook when you stay with Deedee. Our “insider” knowledge of NYC, Jersey City and Hoboken will help make the most from your visit.

10. **Jaw-dropping views**

Staying just across the Hudson River, you’ll see something the average hotel guest doesn’t—the magnificent New York City skyline, day and night. Join commuters strolling the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway for the view. Deedee’s sky-rise apartments treat you to spectacular wraparound views of Lower Manhattan with its centerpiece Freedom Tower from the 34th and 35th floors\! Watch ferries, sailboats and cruise ships crisscrossing the Hudson River from your living room or bedroom. As dusk approaches, the setting sun casts a golden glow over the skyline before darkness reveals the glitter of a million jewels in “the city that never sleeps”.

11. **Kitchen envy** 

Forget about room service and a pricy minibar. Having a full kitchen means everybody can start the day with a nutritious breakfast and you can fortify yourself with an incredible cup of coffee (or two) from the Keurig coffeemaker\! Stock the full-size refrigerator with healthy fruits and veggies from the farmer’s market, along with juices for the kids, craft beer, wine or whatever you crave at the end of the day. Nothing beats the convenience of not having to eat out for every meal (not always fun with kids) and you can save hundreds of dollars eating healthier\! Our modern kitchens are equipped with top-of-the-line appliances, a range of cooking utensils, a complete set of dinnerware, even wineglasses. If you can’t find what you need, we’re happy to supply it.

12. **Location, Location, Location**

I love mixing with the locals—eating what they eat, shopping where they shop, immersing myself in a different culture. So, choosing the vibrant, multiethnic communities of Jersey City and Hoboken as homes for Deedee’s Apartments was deliberate. You’ll feel anything but stranded staying right in the heart of the vibrant downtown with great restaurants shopping and lively nightlife steps from your door.
