# **A Date with Deedee: Things to Do with Your Valentine in NYC**

Valentine’s Day is coming\! If you’re a romantic like me, you may be planning a just-the-two-of-you getaway to celebrate. Or, maybe there is a surprise proposal, honeymoon or special anniversary in your future? If you re-watch classics like *Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Ghost* and *When Harry Met Sally*, you know NYC is the perfect setting for romance. But coming back from a candlelight dinner or a carriage ride in the park to a cramped, cookie-cutter hotel room can really steal the magic from your special time together. 

Deedee’s Apartments do just the opposite. Our stylish lofts, flats, duplexes and skyrise apartments extend your romantic adventures by offering privacy, pampering amenities and personal service hotels rarely match. All just a short PATH train ride from Manhattan. 

**Love at first sight**  
Imagine treating yourselves to a “night in” with the glittering Manhattan skyline spread out before you \[link to: [https://deedeesapartments.com/amazing-apartments/top-floor-2br-apartment-with-amazing-nyc-views/](https://deedeesapartments.com/amazing-apartments/top-floor-2br-apartment-with-amazing-nyc-views/)\], toasting your love on your own private furnished rooftop \[link to: [https://deedeesapartments.com/amazing-apartments/luxury-2-br-loft-and-roof-deck-near-grove-st-path/](https://deedeesapartments.com/amazing-apartments/luxury-2-br-loft-and-roof-deck-near-grove-st-path/)\] after a day exploring the city or snuggling up in a elegant king-size four-poster bed \[link to: [https://deedeesapartments.com/amazing-apartments/stylishly-restored-3br-garden-duplex-downtown-jc/](https://deedeesapartments.com/amazing-apartments/stylishly-restored-3br-garden-duplex-downtown-jc/)\]. 

If you’re celebrating a special occasion, we’ll even have flowers, champagne and a cake waiting for you when you arrive. When you book with Deedee’s, you can linger over a full breakfast without the maid knocking at your door, keep your favorite foods and cocktails on hand without stressing over astronomical minibar charges and get the scoop on the most romantic ways to experience NYC from a trusted insider—me\!

**Stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge**  
The panoramic views of Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Statue of Liberty from this iconic Gothic-style span are magnificent at any time of day, but especially magical as the sun sets and the city lights begin twinkling all around you. Dress warmly and take your time strolling along the 1.3-mile-long (2.09 kilometers) narrow pedestrian promenade. You may want to continue your walk along the East River shoreline in Brooklyn Bridge Park, where you can ride on vintage, hand-painted Jane’s Carousel or cuddle up on a bench and soak up the view. 

To get to the pedestrian entrance for the Brooklyn Bridge walk from the PATH Station at One World Trade Center, head southeast on Vesey Street toward Greenwich Street. Turn left onto West Broadway and right on Barclay Street to Park Row and Centre Street. The entrance is just across Centre Street by City Hall.

**Take a horse-drawn carriage ride**  
It sounds cliché…until you’re wrapped in a blanket with the clip-clop of horse’s hooves and feel the sun on your face on a leisurely tour of Central Park. If you’re ready to pop the question, you can arrange to stop and propose at an uber-romantic spot like Bow Bridge or splurge on a package \[link to: [https://fareharbor.com/embeds/book/unlimitedbiking/items/16641/calendar/2019/11/?asn=freetoursbyfoot\&full-items=yes\&ref=freetoursbyfoot](https://fareharbor.com/embeds/book/unlimitedbiking/items/16641/calendar/2019/11/?asn=freetoursbyfoot&full-items=yes&ref=freetoursbyfoot)\] that concludes with lunch at Central Park’s famous Tavern on the Green.

**Rendezvous atop the Empire State Building**  
Long before *Sleepless in Seattle*, the 1957 film *An Affair to Remember* made the Empire State Building a landmark for lovers. After falling in love aboard a cruise, Nickie (Cary Grant) and Terry (Deborah Kerr) planned to rendezvous in six months at the 102-story Art Deco skyscraper at 350 Fifth Avenue, calling it “the closest thing to heaven in this city”. 

Although it’s no longer the tallest building in New York City, its main deck on the 86th floor is the highest open-air observatory in NYC. If you’re an early bird, you may want to watch the sun rise over Manhattan \[[https://ticketing.esbnyc.com/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?CG=Sunrise\&C=Sun](https://ticketing.esbnyc.com/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?CG=Sunrise&C=Sun)\] from the 86th floor. This experience is limited to only 100 guests each day, so be sure to book well in advance\! 

**Ice skate hand-in-hand at Wollman Rink**  
Speaking of cinematic settings, Wollman Rink has featured in romantic films from *Love Story* to *Serendipity*. Strap on some skates and glide out there on the ice, with the NYC skyline as a backdrop. The rink is near the 59th Street and Fifth Avenue entrance to Central Park. The (cash-only) price Friday through Sunday is $29 (plus tax)—$10 for skate rental and $19 admission. Why not plan to warm up at the Museum of Modern Art, just a 10-minute walk from the rink, on the same date for a combined price \[link to: [https://www.getyourguide.com/new-york-city-l59/new-york-city-ice-skating-and-museum-of-modern-art-ticket-t317697/?partner\_id=34FAF\&cmp=IceskatingNYCComboMomaWollmanRink](https://www.getyourguide.com/new-york-city-l59/new-york-city-ice-skating-and-museum-of-modern-art-ticket-t317697/?partner_id=34FAF&cmp=IceskatingNYCComboMomaWollmanRink)\] of $38?

**Tour St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral Catacombs by candlelight**  
Trade the candlelight dinner for a candlelight of Old St. Patrick’s, the 200-year-old Basilica of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral at 260–264 Mulberry Street (between Prince and Houston Streets in Nolita). The 90-minute tour ushers you underground into areas only recently opened to the public, where you’ll see the Henry Erban Organ and the Catacombs. If walking through the crypts of prominent New Yorkers buried here with only candles to light your way feels a little spooky, all the better reason to hold your love extra tight\!

**Dine at One if by Land, Two if by Sea**  
This restaurant has witnessed more engagements than any other Manhattan restaurant. Dining in this renovated stone carriage house, with its brick fireplaces, floor-to-ceiling windows, baby grand piano and private garden, is a special occasion even without a proposal. Dress up and splurge on a three-course prix fixe menu or seven-course Chef’s Tasting Menu with wine pairings. The food is divine and the service exceptional. 

Its history is tasty, too. Located at 17 Barrow Street, between Seventh Avenue South and West 4th Street, the carriage house once housed the coach and horses of Aaron Burr during his tenure as New York State’s Attorney General in 1790s. After Burr lost the property when he killed Alexander Hamilton in a famous duel on July 11, 1840, it became a stop on the Underground Railroad, a brothel and a silent movie house before taking its place as NYC’s most romantic restaurant.

## **Step back in time at the Cloisters**

Set on four acres in lovely Fort Tryon Park overlooking the Hudson River, the Medieval-style Cloisters were built with materials from five French cloisters to house the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s collection of approximately 2,000 works of art from 12th to 15th century Europe, including exquisite illuminated manuscripts, stained glass, metalwork, enamels, ivories and tapestries.

Be sure to check out the famous Unicorn Tapestries, the 12th-century chapel of the church of San Martín in Fuentidueña, Spain, and the Merode Triptych, representing the Annunciation, from the workshop of the 15th-century Netherlandish master Robert Campin. 

Three of the reconstructed cloisters feature gardens planted according to horticultural information found in medieval treatises and poetry, garden documents and herbals. 

**Sip a cocktail at The Campbell**  
The main concourse at Grand Central, with its 1913 Beaux Arts star-studded ceiling, is a favorite place for proposals—often to crowd applause. But you may want to hold out for The Campbell (15 Vanderbilt Avenue, just off 43rd Street). Once the private office of Jazz Age financier John W. Campbell, this elegant space is a 13th century Florentine-inspired jewel box. The 25-foot (7.6 meters) hand-painted ceilings, original millwork, grand stone fireplace, a century-old leaded glass window are accented by towering palm trees. 

Step out to The Campbell Terrace, an expansive outdoor covered veranda and toast your discriminating style with a glass of wine or classic cocktail. Or try one of the house cocktails such as a Lavender Gimlet (gin, lavender bitters and fresh lemon).
